Facade Design pattern is used to make an abstract layer
which will interact with the system and client need to 
know about that layer only.
eg: suppose we need to purchase an order so
step1: select an item
step2: make payment
step3: generate invoice
step4: push notification

so it is very difficult for the client to have idea about
each and every function
so you can create a 

public void placeOrderFacade()
{
	select a item();
	makePayment();
	generateInvoice();
	pushNotification();
}
