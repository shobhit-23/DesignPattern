The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object 
to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is 
particularly useful when an object needs to change its behavior dynamically
based on its state, without using complex conditional statements.


Means suppose there is a vending machine so it will have some states 
and whenever you will perform any operation there so its state will 
get changes between IdleState and Working State.

Vending Machine will consist state.
